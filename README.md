# Drip-Calculator

This app's intent is to quickly provide the amount of shares and money necessary to get a DRIP of a certain asset. It uses data from Yahoo Finance and requires only the ticker symbol (same as used on Yahoo) from the user. The server is written in Python using Flask and the front end is written in HTML and CSS.
